To be clear, these are not uncertainties it is possible to eliminate by building a better telescope or being more careful. They are simply a result of doing an experiment in which one is, essentially, counting things.\n",

    "The expected uncertainty in an experiment in which you count, on average, $N$ events in a process in which the individual events are independent and the rate of the events is constant over the time time interval in which you sample is $\\sqrt{N}$. This holds no matter what you are counting: radioactive decays, responses to a survey of randomly selected individuals, or photons from a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about this uncertainty is that if you repeat the experiment several times you will measure a different value for $N$ each time, and the range in valuse you should expect to get is $\\sqrt{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *size* of the error increases with $N$ but the fractional error, i.e. the error divided by the number measured, is $\\sqrt{N}/N = 1/\\sqrt{N}$, which *decreases* with $N$. This is, roughly, why measurements of fainter stars are noisier than observations of brighter stars (fainter and brighter in this context meaning the two extremes of what a particular camera/telescope can measure in an exposure)."

It is the signal (i.e. count) divided by the error, or $SNR = N/\\sqrt{N} = \\sqrt{N}$. *Note well* that this is not, in many cases, the appropriate equation to use when doing astronmical photometry because there is more than one source of error, so the error is *not* simply $\\sqrt{N}$.\n",
