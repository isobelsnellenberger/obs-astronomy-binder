    "1. Information about the Paul P. Feder Observatory is at the observatory blog; of particular importance later in this activity are the longitude, latitude and elevation: [http://astronomy.mnstate.edu/Feder_Observatory/](http://astronomy.mnstate.edu/Feder_Observatory/)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simbad is the go-to source for basic information like coordinates or magnitude of an object. It is at: [http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/). There are several ways you can look up information but the examples below will all use a [basic identifier search](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fbasic).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The [American Association of Variable Star Observers](http://aavso.org) (AAVSO) finder charts are a quick way to generate a finding chart for many objects (it is also possible to do something similar in simbad, but the AAVSO site is easier to use for that). You can find charts here for many objects that are not variable stars. The form for generating finding charts is at: https://www.aavso.org/apps/vsp/\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The AAVSO's [Variable Star Index (VSX)](https://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=search.top) has, for many variable stars, both basic information about the star and predictions of the time at which the maximum brightness (for a pulsating variable) or primary eclipse (for an eclipsing binary) will occur over the following few days.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The [Exoplanet Transit Database](http://var2.astro.cz/ETD/index.php) has both predictions of when exoplanet transits will occur (though you have to provide the latitude and longitude of the observatory) and finding charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are (at least) a couple of options for checking whether a specific object is visible on a specific night. One is [JSkyCalc](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~physics/labs/skycalc/flyer.html), which has the virtues of being free and running on any computer that has Java. It is a little difficult to use the interface and you will need to add information (lat/lon/elevation) about our observatory. Another is [astroplan](https://astroplan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a python-based solution demonstrated below. It is also free, and requires information about the site, and requires you to be comfortable enough with a computer to be willing to modify the example code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to look up information from some of these sources from directly from a notebook like this one using [astroquery](http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but this typically takes at least a little programming. A simple example will be shown below, though.\n"
